workspaces-to-dock
==================

A Gnome Shell extension that transforms the workspaces of the overview mode into an intellihide dock.  The dock is positioned and sized to maintain tight integration with the Gnome Shell.


MULTIPLE MONITORS:
If you are using multiple monitors, it is recommended that you turn off the workspaces-only-on-primary option under org->gnome->shell->overrides (use dconf-editor). Gnome 3.4 seems buggy when using multiple monitors with the workspaces-only-on-primary option turned on.
