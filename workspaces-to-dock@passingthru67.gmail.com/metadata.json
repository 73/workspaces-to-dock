The dock is positioned and sized to maintain tight integration with the Gnome Shell.\n\nThe latest release includes a pressure threshold option to trigger the dock (GS 3.8+ only), the ability to customize the thumbnail size, the ability to toggle the dock using a keyboard shortcut, and RTL support.\n\nPlease see the Github homepage for details on installation, settings, known issues, and version features. A backport is also available on Github for Gnome Shell 3.2 users (v6 only).",
